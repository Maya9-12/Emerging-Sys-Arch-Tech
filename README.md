##Milestone 2 UART GPIO Lab 

The goal of this project was to control the red LEDs on my TI board using a single byte store in a serial buffer. I used a switch case to read one character at a time as the LEDs turned on when the user types "ON" and off when the user types "OFF". One thing I believe I did particularly well at was incorporating that the user could type both words in either capital letters or lower case. Prior to this class, I had no experience using CCStudio and little experience using C, but this class/project made me more comfortable in my programming abilities which can be transferred to other projects and/or course work. My code is well commented making it easy to understand at a basic level and can easily be used to write new code that originates from this project. 

  

##Temperature Project 

For this project, I was tasked with developing a thermostat prototype that could read a room's temperature, indicate the result via LED output, increase or decrease the set temperature and simulate data being sent to a server. I believe my variables and the structure of my code were meaningful and easy to remember. Making use of a task schedular was a requirement of this project, therefore I believe I could have improved my code by more clearly stating where I made use of this function. This was my first attempt at programming a device to read temperatures using a temperature sensor, adding to my knowledge of programming embedded devices. The use of state machines and task schedulers will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work. The use of my small, modular functions made testing and debugging easier while also making the code reusable and adaptable.
